# painting-with-roughness â€” React + TypeScript

### Quick Start

1. `npm install`  
2. `npm run dev`

This project uses **Vite + React + TypeScript**. The primary app is `src/App.tsx` (default export component).  

The canvas is responsive; use the controls to start/stop, step, randomize, and clear the simulation.

### Controls

You can get rid of the settings window by dragging it offscreen.  

Pressing **Shift** will cause it to reappear where your mouse is.
